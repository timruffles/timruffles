Models and Collections are the core of any Backbone application. They’re also, fortunately, the easiest part to test. Being pure Javascript setting up the tests is simple, and there’s nothing non-blocking or long-running.

The only tricky part to test is persistence, but this should always be tested separately and walled off from the code that’s modelling your problem.

First, some tutorials I’ve seen suggest testing parts of your models’ behaviour that are entirely down to Backbone, like the results of `set`, `defaults` or the presence of attributes after the controller fires. I’d strongly argue against it. You’re writing utterly fragile tests for very little benefit.

## Testing synchronous code

This is as easy as testing gets. If we’re testing something that doesn’t require state in the model, our tests will have two lines of code:

    “periods not starting on a month are custom”: function() {
	}

title: Boycott the unhappy
draft: true
body: |

  Buy things from happy people only, turn away from those with dead eyes. Seek out those who greet you with sunny smiles, who brim with joy in their work. If we all shied from slaves to expediency, soon there would be no market for their slave owners.
  
  Not only compassion compels us, but self-interest! If there is no market for their misery there is none for ours. So: seek the work that makes you happy and seek to give work to those happy in it; if all were happy in their work, what a world of difference that would make.

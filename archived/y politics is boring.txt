title: Politics - nerdy
draft: true
body: |

  To me, the remarkable thing about watching two elite martial artists fight is how distinctly unreamarkable it is. They share knowledge of innumerable fantastically exciting ways of dispatching an opponent to the mat, but the spectator never gets to see it. Both know and respect the other's skill, and hold back from trying anything that might win the fight and amaze the crowd for fear that they will be the one flat on their back.

  Which brings to mind another dull and conservative combat: politics, the primary combatants the government and opposition, sharing a common foe in the press. All are masters of their art. But all know the others' skill. Neither the government nor opposition risks the big policy move that could properly put a problem on its back, for it would mean a step off the political centre of gravity. Vested interests mean that any real change to the status quo is a step into danger. The press is so powerful and so polarised, that a step in either direction will see half the country whipped to a frenzy over the breakfast table by biting editorials or screaming headlines. 
  
  With both combatants so concerned with not putting a step wrong, is it any surprise that the right step is seldom made?

              <h1><a href="/new-project-sidekickjs---javascript-code-quality-tool">New project: SidekickJS - Javascript code quality tool</a></h1>
  <p>I&#39;ve started work on a new potential startup: <a href="https://www.sidekickjs.com" >SidekickJS, a Javascript code-quality tool</a>. It analyses your Javascript repository for basic Javascript issues, repetition, complexity and alerts you of changes. It&#39;s intended to replace a lot of the code-review boiler-plate I encountered while leading Javascript teams.</p>
<h2 id="going-it-alone">Going it alone</h2>
<p>I&#39;m going it alone for now, which is something I said I&#39;d <a href="/exambuff-open-sourced-startup" >not do again</a>. However - I very much do want a co-founder. Everyone I want to co-found with has a job they can&#39;t leave soon for various reasons</p>
<p>Additionally this time I can validate it myself. It&#39;s a programming tool and I can market to programmers: it&#39;s a matter of doing what I do already - blog posts, speaking at conferences and going to meetups. In addition I know people at around 15 companies I can validate the idea with.</p>
<h2 id="progress-so-far">Progress so far</h2>
<p>This is now week 13! I finished my contract at Skimlinks on February 10th. I&#39;m currently working with my first beta-testers, so I&#39;m quite pleased with progress. It&#39;s quite easy to spend a lot of time arguing about stuff with co-founders early in a startup - there&#39;s so little information to go on it&#39;s hunches all the way down. Having 0 communication overhead and no discussions makes it easy to get stuff done - you just have to hope it&#39;s the right stuff!</p>
<p>Technically the project is Ruby + Javascript for the analysis, Rails + Postgres for the interface, Chef for server management. Going full-stack again has been a lot of fun so far: that said, I&#39;m looking forward to validating so I can get a designer on board!</p>
<h2 id="join-the-beta">Join the beta</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re on a Javascript team or know anybody else who is please <a href="https://www.sidekickjs.com" >join the beta</a>! Any questions give <a href="http://twitter.com/sidekicksrc" >let me know</a>. I&#39;ll also be blogging about <a href="http://sidekicksrc.com" >programming and bootstrapping</a> at <a href="http://sidekicksrc.com" >sidekicksrc.com</a>.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>

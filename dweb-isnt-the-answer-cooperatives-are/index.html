              <h1><a href="/dweb-isnt-the-answer-cooperatives-are">DWeb isn't the answer, cooperatives are</a></h1>
  <p>I think cooperatives may be a better alternative to centralised, FANG(M)-style, software than current distributed web (DWeb) solutions.</p>
<p>Distributed software is a &#39;solve people/culture/legal problems with software&#39; move that hasn&#39;t, and can&#39;t work. DWeb solutions will always have a worse user-experience compared to centralised software, and non-developers (or even developers, as users) don&#39;t care enough about the risks of centralisation to accept that.</p>
<p>Cooperatives could have as good a user-experience, without centralisation. Build a OSS platform, host it, and charge for it. License the software in a way that restricts it to other cooperatives. Let&#39;s consider a cooperative gmail alternative. Users pay in $1 a month for a hosted version of an open-sourced gmail-like service. All software is open-source, and anyone is free to fork and create their own cooperative (has to be a cooperative), so there&#39;s no lock-in. The cooperative has some democratic system to determine who is paid to work on the software, which features are developed, etc.</p>
<p>Without the need to decentralised it can be built with standard tools. Further, because the cooperative&#39;s interests are aligned with users, cooperative software is a much safer platform for independent software vendors to build on. There would be no reason to lock-down/deprecate/charge for platform APIs like Twitter etc.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say we find a team of 5 developers/designers etc who are willing to accept $80k P/A to work fully remote on cooperative, open-source software. I haven&#39;t a clue about the hosting cost of gmail, let&#39;s just wildly guess $100k P/A to support 42k users. $400k salaries + $100k hosting = $500k P/A, which could be paid for by 42k users at $1 a month.</p>
<p>My gut feel is finding a small, passionate team of those worried about centralisation (we know they exist, they&#39;re building the DWeb after all), that can compete vs centralised software on equal terms, is more likely to succeed than a large unpaid mass of developers trying to compete with the huge UX handicap of centralisation.</p>

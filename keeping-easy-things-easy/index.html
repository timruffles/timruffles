              <h1><a href="/keeping-easy-things-easy">Keeping easy things easy</a></h1>
  <p>There&#39;s a trend in front-end development to want to use the &#39;best practice&#39; tools in every project, no matter the size or complexity. This seems to be a way to signal (to ourselves as much as others) competence through tribal membership: i.e I use cool tools so I must be good.</p>
<p>But engineering is about trade-offs. Sometimes a <a href="http://www.moock.org/blog/archives/000310.html" >raft</a> is the way to get people across the river, and a cantilevered bridge is folly. The bridge is outwardly a more eye-catching sign of competence. But when misapplied it&#39;s actually the opposite, as with development tools: build automation, CSS &amp; JS transpilers and module systems.</p>
<p>A fluency with weighing trade-offs is the definition of graduating from being an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" >advanced-beginner</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>limited situational perception</li>
<li>all aspects of work treated separately with equal importance</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#39;re being advanced-beginners when we don&#39;t weigh the attributes - scale, duration, team-size, complexity - that make a project deserve a complex workflow. We should be careful not to treat &#39;best practices&#39; as goals in themselves.</p>
<p>Expertise isn&#39;t only making hard things possible; it&#39;s keeping easy things easy.</p>

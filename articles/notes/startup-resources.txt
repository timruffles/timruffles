  I always try out business/marketing/startup books in the shop or on Google books. The rubbishy ones are easy to spot - finishable in 15 minutes by ignoring the repetition and excessive anecdotes. Probably wise to do the same with these suggestions.
  
  ## Business
  
  * [*The New Business Road Test*](http://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Business-Road-Test-Entrepreneurs/dp/0273708058), J Mullins
    * The core technical questions about a business in as much detail as they need. Macro and micro market and industry, including Porter's five forces
  * [*Four Steps to the Epiphany*](http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/four-steps-to-the-epiphany/390408), Steve Blank
    * Especially good are the checklists at the back - you could successfully run your business by working through them, making sure you've actually done what they ask
  
  ## Code
  
  I think that unless you're writing code for a big company, it's very easy to spent too much time worrying about technical issues. With that in mind, [*The Pragmatic Programmer*](http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer) has tips that'll actually save you time, rather than over-engineer your code.
  
  ## Inspiration
  
  * [*The Fountainhead*](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fountainhead-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/0141188626), Ayn Rand
    * Inspirational, if its politics are a bit silly. A lot better written than *Atlas Shrugged*.
    
  ## UX
  
  * [*Inmates are Running the Asylum*](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inmates-are-Running-Asylum-High-tech/dp/0672326140/), Alan Cooper
  
  UX books get samey; there's a lot of actionable detail in the above.
  
  ## Marketing
  
  Strikes me as a subject where the basics (blogging, Twitter (not Facebook unless you're a game)) are obvious and the rest are not things a startup can do without huge risk of wasting time or money (advertising, viral). Make a great product first and foremost.
  
  ## Other people's lists
  
  [Ycombinator's](http://ycombinator.com/lib.html) is great.

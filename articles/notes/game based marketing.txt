  Loyalty = Stickiness

  When he discusses existing reward schemes in the book (McDonalds Monopoly, 'Chase picks up the tab'), his suggestions are repetitive: put it online, to reduce costs and increase scope.

    * 'Whether your brand is on the leading or trailing edge of this unmistakable gamification trend is up to you, but the outcome is inevitable: everything is about to be made more fun' p 200
    * FFP - frequent flier programs
      * Decoupled from original reward - free flights etc
        * Often not claimed - 22 years worth unclaimed @ present
        * More for status
      * Successful enough to motivate 'Mileage runs'
        * ppl pick inconvenient flights - either so bad they're worth extra points, or just longer - to win more points
      * Flyertalk.com - community of ppl fanatical about FFP
    * Funware
      * Components required for funware
        * Points - see how you're doing/what it's worth, how you're doing vs others
        * Rules - so it's fair
        * Demonstrability - show others how well you've done
    * Jigsaw.com
      * Points for uploading ppls' contact details
        * LinkedIn via third parties
      * Couldn't have afforded to pay ppl to do this
      * So did it via points
      * Via leaderboards and status incentivised ppl to submit masses of details
    * Walmart
      * Leaderboard masterclass
      * Make users feel good - maintain hope
        * First leaderboard shown compares vs nearest competitors
        * Then vs friends, to create social context and pressure
        * Then traditional top 10
      * Keep hope alive! You can win!
      * [Mafia wars does this too - shows you ppl with ranks close to you in attack screen, not level 9999 uber player]
    * FFP beat green stamps because it was more fun!
      * Moving from direct link between action and remuneration increases flexibility
      * Inflate/deflate economy
      * Change gearing to change incentives
    * America's Army - computer game created to increase recruits among young
      * badges ranks etc
    * Random awards
      * Racks up addiction
      * Sweepstake
        * legal as no investment of time/money
      * User flagging to reduce gaming
    * Team games in FFP v effective
    * Bartle's four types of player
      * Achiever - beat challenges - social context improves achievement
      * Socialisers - enjoy social element > game
      * Explorers - intrinsic reward from the playing of the game, not the end point
      * Killers - enjoy games as far as they can explicitly beat other ppl
    * 'Pink Cadillac' for top performers in sales org
      * Motivates thru demo status to employers for customers
    * 'Behind this slavish devotion to the perks of FFPs lies a disarmingly simple conclusion: game mechanics such as points, badges, rewards, levels, challenges, and leaderboards can be combined to create powerful loyalty tools that can work for any brand ... toolset for savvy marketers looking to break through the noise to create enduring loyalty' p 199
    * By being plays in a game of status, all purchases and brands are effectively involved in a social game

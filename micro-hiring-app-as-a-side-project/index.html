  <p>I&#39;d like to make a product that makes money; not much, just enough to know I can do it. I&#39;m inspired by people like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/" >Patrick McKenzie</a> - very successful software for making bingo cards (really). Great talk on Software for <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/patio11/software-for-underserved-markets" >Underserved Markets</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kreci.net/" >KreCi</a> - on the other hand, making a modest amount. I admire the drive though.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve made three products in the past - one that took a long time, one that we thought we were making in the Lean Startup way, one that I made in the Lean Startup style. I&#39;ll write about them later.</p>
<h2 id="the-product">The Product</h2>
<p>A simple hiring app, that creates an application form. When candidates apply you and colleagues can vote on, or filter out, candidates. That&#39;s it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m focussing heavily on the UX, with inspiration from zero-signup products like <a href="http://doodle.com/" >Doodle</a>. No passwords to remember, just private urls that can be regenerated.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve decided to build an MVP for it, without doing customer discovery, because it&#39;s something I&#39;d like myself. I know full well that skipping discovery makes it orders of magnitude more likely post 4 or 5 will be &quot;Nobody bought it&quot;. If that happens, at least it&#39;s an interesting way to try out Knockout.js, and I could use it for a screencast.</p>
<h2 id="the-goal">The Goal</h2>
<p>I&#39;d like to launch it by July 14th. That feels like a long way off, but I know how hard fitting things around work is.</p>

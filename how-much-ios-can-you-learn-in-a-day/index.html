  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>In one day, starting with no Objective C/iOS knowledge, what can you make? Using O'Reilly's <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9781449327088/" title="Programming iOS">Programming iOS</a>, the quick <a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec/">Objective C guide</a> and <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/5138/beginning-storyboards-in-ios-5-part-1">Matthijs Hollemans's</a> guide to iOS, it's quite plausible to have built a simple <a href="#day-zero">add items to a list</a> app by the day's end. Kudos Apple!</p>
</div>

<p>I wanted to make an app that helps you achieve your goals. Mobile seemed the only sensible way to deliver a goal tracking application, as when you&#39;ve just finished your run you&#39;d want to tick it off then and there.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-html5">Why not HTML5?</h2>
<p>I had a look for HTML5 frameworks but all of their UIs seemed sluggish and ugly. I know how hard it is to match the level of interaction and detail iOS has. I&#39;ve previously made a performance focussed mobile framework for an unreleased game with <a href="http://picklive.com" >Picklive</a>. It ran smoothly only by cheating: it didn&#39;t have to emulate scrolling as all views fit the screen.</p>
<p>Since this app would have lots of lists, it seemed like 90% of the work would be reimplementing (badly) views iOS gave you for free (which look beautiful). I decided to take a peek to see how quickly I could get up to speed.</p>
<h2 id="memory-management-in-2012">Memory management: in 2012?!</h2>
<p>The reason I persevered is probably <code>@autoreleasepool</code>. This <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/ObjectiveC/RN-TransitioningToARC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011226" >rather magic compiler addition</a> allows you to get your hands dirty without being faced with the additional yak-shaving of memory management piled top of learning a new language and the rather sizeable Cocoa APIs. It&#39;s a new feature of iOS 5, and during the  admittedly simple work I did it worked without a hitch.</p>
<h2 id="xcode">XCode</h2>
<p>I&#39;m normally a vim user, so booting up the IDE was a bit of a shock. That said, it&#39;s a lot faster than I remember Eclipse or NetBeans, and has Apple slickness aplently.</p>
<p>The Storyboard is impressive. Drag to bind UI actions to transitions, or generate code that obtains references to UI widgets by dragging. Interface Builder is also drag&#39;n&#39;drop, with pallets to modify fonts, colours etc. </p>
<img alt="Storyboard view" src="/img/storyboard.png">

<p>It&#39;s great. I&#39;ve done a fair bit of work with Flex in the past and I enjoyed this approach a lot more. Flex had an interface builder which output <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MXML" >MXML</a>. This markup was used to bind data and events. It felt a lot clunkier. I prefer this approach: view implementation hidden away in the .board rather than in an additional markup layer, and doing anything complicated in code.</p>
<p>That said, I&#39;ve only done extremely simply work so far, and perhaps there are storyboard monsters lurking for more complicated apps.</p>
<h2 id="objective-c">Objective C</h2>
<p>The language is a little ugly, but if you take 10 minutes to carefully peruse the message passing the biggest obstacle is overcome. I made 2.5k words of notes on the language features and API so there&#39;s a fair bit to learn. It&#39;s pleasantly modern: you get proper enumerators rather than old-skool <code>for(int i ...)</code> loops, <code>object.property</code> notation (not silly <code>object-&gt;property</code>), and inline <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/bxGettingStarted.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007502-CH7-SW1" >lambda/blocks</a>.</p>
<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>
<p>So all in all I&#39;m dead impressed. It was pretty steady going to get my head around grabbing the <code>ViewControllers</code>, wiring up events and segues (transitions) and creating and sharing a simple mutable array as the model, storing my <code>Project</code>s.</p>
<p>XCode hides a lot of verbosity and boiler plate from you. I&#39;d much prefer to read complicated or algorithmic code in another language (take your pick of Haskell, Ruby, Python, Coffeescript), but Objective C is OK. Its message-passing nature has a nice quirk in making methods self-documenting in the extreme. Message names include a colon for each parameter, so <code>makeTriple:::</code>. It&#39;s nice to give hints to the arguments, so <code>colorWithRed: (int) red green: (int) green blue: (int) blue</code>.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t see any barriers to getting the app done fast, and, best of all, I&#39;m spending all of my time implementing the app rather than re-implementing generic UI elements. Yay! I&#39;m planning to rewrite what I&#39;ve got with CoreData, and then press on with integrating it with the Rails-based backend.</p>

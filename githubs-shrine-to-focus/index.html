  <p>Hearing Github <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/09/github-lays-off-10-and-goes-fully-remote/" >is closing</a> its offices made me want to share my favourite thing about their HQ. Out of all the
offices I&#39;ve worked from, it was the one that made me feel like it was designed
by and for makers.</p>
<p>There was a lot to like. Clocks showing epoch time, hammock room, an amazing bar, and of course the room everyone&#39;s heard about: the secret one. But none of that was what made fall in love with the place.</p>
<p>It was the library:</p>
<p><img src="/./img/gh/library.jpeg" alt="github office library" /></p>
<p>On joining, you were asked for a book to put in the library. Looking through the range of books people had picked made me feel even more that Githubbers were my kind of people (I chose â€˜The Tartar Steppeâ€™):</p>
<img src="/./img/gh/hubber-books.jpeg" title="Iain M Banks, Borges, Soul of a New Machine, Eco, Three Body Problem: so many good books">

<p>The shelf of O&#39;Reilly books also made me happy. I started
learning backend development from a copy of &#39;PHP and MySQL&#39; (the one with a platypus) found in the freebie bin outside a bookshop in Paris. To this day I learn best sitting down with a hard copy, probably adorned with some obscure creature. Seeing a whole rack of the books spoke to me of why I love being a developer: the breadth and depth of the field, the stream of new tools we have to build cool things with, and the joy of learning them.</p>
<p>The library walls were lined with niches for focused work. It&#39;s mystifying to me how few companies truly do anything to lionise
and defend focused work. The whole room felt like a physical demonstration that GH valued it:</p>
<p><img src="/./img/gh/niche.jpeg" alt="github library niche" /></p>
<p>I&#39;m remote now, but if anything would tempt me back, itâ€™d be interesting work at a company whose office had a library...</p>
